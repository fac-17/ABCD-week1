#### WHY / WHAT / HOW
Building a one page website from scratch that provides a short agency portfolio for our team.

The website has to include 4 parts:
- Headline -> introduce the agency
- About -> few lines about who we are and what we do
- Team -> our profiles + links to our linkedIn / GitHub / Codewars accounts
- Contact -> contact form

**Has to be improve :**
-  Mobile accessibility
- CSS hierarchie (too many id...)
- Color contrast for people visually impaired
- Make it more interactive


## USER STORY
**As a client looking to hire a team of developers**

- [x] I want to visit your site and immediately see a headline about your team. So that I get a concise description of what you have to offer me.

- [x] I want to visit your site and see a navigation link for 'About, Team, and Contact', so I can quickly navigate to the areas of the site I'd like to visit.

- [x] I want to be able to contact the developers by filling out and submitting a form by providing my name, email and message information. So that the team have sufficient information to contact me afterwards

- [x] I want to click on a navigation link and a corresponding section be made visible in the browser window on the same page. So that I can quickly navigate around the site without having to wait for new pages to be loaded.


**Accessibility**

- [x] I want to easily view the site when browsing on my mobile, tablet or desktop. So that I can understand the sites content easily on whatever device I choose to view it in.

- [x] I would like to easily read and understand the text on your site. So I can understand the information available.

- [ ] As a blind client... I would like to easily understand how to navigate the site after my screen reader reads me the content of the site. So I can understand the information available.

- [x] As a client with JavaScript disabled in their browser for security reasons

- [x] I would like to visit your site and get a similar experience to viewing your site on a modern browser with JavaScript enabled. So that I don't feel like I'm completely in the stone age.
